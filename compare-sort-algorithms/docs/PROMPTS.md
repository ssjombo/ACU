# Add C# (.cs) to our sorting benchmark project 

  I want to add C# (dotnet) to my sorting algorithm comparison project. Hereâ€™s what I need:
 
  1. **Update the Makefile:**
       Add build and run targets for C# sorting algorithms using dotnet 9.0.
       Update the clean target to remove C# build artifacts.
       Add C# to the build dependencies.
 
  2. **Add C# implementations** for these sorting algorithms under `src/`:
       bubble_sort.cs
       insertion_sort.cs
       selection_sort.cs
       merge_sort.cs
       quick_sort.cs
       counting_sort.cs
       radix_sort.cs
       **Important:** The C# code for each algorithm should be as similar as possible to the C++ implementation in terms of logic, structure, and input/output format, while following C# best practices and .NET conventions.
 
  3. **Update the Python scripts**:
       `run_comparison.py`: Add C# execution and timing.
       `analyze_results.py`: Include C# in the analysis.
       `visualize_results.py`: Add C# to the visualizations.
       `generate json results.py`: Include C# data in the JSON output.
  4. **Update the README.md**
  5. ** Update **HOWTO.md**
  
  The goal is to have C# implementations that can be compared fairly with the existing C, C++, Java, Go, JavaScript, Python, and Rust implementations.
 
  Please help me implement these changes one at a time, starting with the Makefile modifications.



# Update `scripts/*.py` to support Rust

We have added `Rust` comparison and `run_comparison.py` now supports Rust.

pls check and update other `srcipts/.*py` to support Rust

# Add Rust to the comparison (Reviewed/Updated by Cursor/Claude)

I need to add Rust support to my sorting algorithm comparison project. Here's what I need:

1. First, help me modify the Makefile to add Rust support:
   - Add Rust executable targets
   - Add compilation rules using rustc
   - Update clean target to remove Rust artifacts
   - Add Rust to the build dependencies

2. Then, help me create Rust implementations of these sorting algorithms:
   - bubble_sort.rs
   - insertion_sort.rs
   - selection_sort.rs
   - merge_sort.rs
   - quick_sort.rs
   - counting_sort.rs
   - radix_sort.rs

   Each implementation should:
   - Follow Rust best practices
   - Include proper error handling
   - Use Rust's type system effectively
   - Include performance optimizations
   - Match the interface of other language implementations

3. Finally, help me modify these Python scripts:
   - run_comparison.py: Add Rust execution and timing
   - analyze_results.py: Include Rust in analysis
   - visualize_results.py: Add Rust to visualizations
   - generate-json-results.py: Include Rust data

The goal is to have Rust implementations that can be compared fairly with the existing implementations in C, C++, Java, Go, JavaScript, and Python.

Please help me implement these changes one at a time, starting with the Makefile modifications.

# I want to add Rust to the comparison (human)

help me with a plan 

- Change Makefile 
- add rust (.rs) codes under `src` 
- change other `scripts/*.py`

create a prompt for me (will talk with Cursor) 

# Include the following sections to the output `analysis/performance_analysis.md` from the source `analyze_results.py`

- Performance metrics (execution time, elements/second)
- Statistical analysis (mean, standard deviation)
- Comparative analysis between languages and algorithms
- Scaling analysis across different dataset sizes
- Practical recommendations for algorithm selection

For Performance Ranking
- Ranks all implementations from fastest to slowest
- Shows relative performance compared to the fastest implementation
- Format: Rank | Language | Time (sec) | vs Fastest

Execution Time Comparison
- Lists execution times for each language/algorithm combination
- Shows "N/A" for skipped implementations (e.g., for large datasets)

Language and Algorithm Analysis
- Provides insights for each programming language
- Includes algorithm-specific analysis
- Shows throughput (elements/second) for each implementation

Cross-Size Performance Analysis
- Analyzes how performance scales with different data sizes
- Shows performance ratios between different dataset sizes
- Provides scaling factors
For Performance Insights
- Identifies fastest and slowest implementations
- Calculates speed difference between fastest and slowest
- Provides statistical analysis:
- Average execution time
- Standard deviation (if more than 2 valid results)

# Generate results in json formats 

Add a new Makefile target `generate-json-results` that runs a script `scripts/generate-json-results.py`.

The script should:
- Read all analysis result files (e.g., `analysis/consolidated_results_*.txt`)
- For each dataset size, extract:  
  - `dataset size`
  - `language`
  - `algorithm`
  - `time` (seconds)
- Output a single JSON file: `results/results-<date-time-stamp>.json`
- Sort the results by dataset size, language, and algorithm
-  If a result is missing, skip or mark as `"N/A"`
- Add any required dependencies to `requirements.txt`

**Example Makefile target:**
```makefile
generate-json-results: analyze
	python3 scripts/generate-json-results.py
```

**Example output:**
```json
[
  {"dataset_size": 10000, "language": "python", "algorithm": "quick", "time": 0.12},
  {"dataset_size": 10000, "language": "cpp", "algorithm": "quick", "time": 0.01}
]
```

# Per-languages and per-algorithms visualization

We have `sorting_performance_loglog.png` generated. this file contains the comparisons for all languages and sort performance.

I want to breakdown the comparions

- Compare the performances of the same sorting algorithms when running with different languages 
- Compare the performances of the same language when running with sorting algorithms

Help me refactor the code and generate different multiple .png files, one for each language and one for each algorithm.



# Update  "Quick Sort Performance Comparison" section in "comparison-2025-06-05-122733.md" (implmented by `run_comparison.py`)

In "comparison-2025-06-05-122733.md"

the table "Quick Sort Performance Comparison" should have the following columns 

- Rank
- Language
- Time (seconds)
- Relative speed 
- Elements/Second

where
- Rank: sort fastest to slowest (ranks: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,)
- Language: C++, C, Java...
- Average Time (seconds): Time to run the sorts
- Relative speed: Rank #1 is "1.00x", Rank #2 is "1.20x" indicates that the language ranked #2 is 1.20 times slower than the language in rank #1 
- Elements/Second: How many items sorted in a second

# Update `run_comparison.py`

so that it read all dataset sizes defined in `number-of-data-points.txt`
and deliver the results in docs/`comparison-2025-06-05-121646.md`

Currently, it only report for dataset size of 1000000 (only one)


`number-of-data-points.txt` looks like: 
```
10000
100000
250000
500000
1000000
``` 

our report should look like:







# Deliver comparison result with `run_comparison.py`

Based on the analysis ` analysis/consolidated_results_xxxx.txt`, e.g ` analysis/consolidated_results_500000.txt`
create a comparision file 

`docs`/comparison-{date-time-stamp}.md

to compare the run time of all languages. 

lower run time is faster = better
higher run time is lower = worst

Compare by language;
Indicate winner with ðŸŸ¢  
indicate slowest with ðŸ”´ 
```

# add new option --help

and provide a help message, example syntax how to run the program

# add an option: --generate-data

Y/N
Yes/No
True/False

default=false (don't re-generate data)

if --generate-data set to Y, Yes or True,
run generate_data.py

# add an option: --repeat=N

example

--repeat=5 

the program will run the sort algorithm 5 times, take the average run time and deliver a report.

# add options --algorithm , --language 

for example, 

if I want to compare C++, Java when sorting with counting sort, I run 

run_comparison.py --algorithm  counting --language=cpp,java


# Change option `data_size` to `size` (--size)

by default, `--size` will be read from config/number-of-data-points.txt
if --size is specified, use the results 

for example

run_comparison.py --algorithm  counting --language=cpp,java --size=250000,500000

will compare cpp, java with counting sort for 2 datasets with size of 250k and 500k

# Visualisation 

Visualisation of the performance results.
Create a file `scripts/visualize_results.py` that generates a log-log plot of execution time vs. data size for each algorithm and language. Use `seaborn` for plotting.

A log-log plot of execution time vs. data size would clearly show the asymptotic behavior of each algorithm and confirm their theoretical time complexities.


# Prompt 11 

run

#file:run_comparison.sh
#file:run_complete_study.sh
#file:run_multi_size_comparison.sh

and update our findings under #file:docs folder

pls note that we are testing multiple number data points (config / #file:number-of-data-points.txt )

# Prompt 10 

For all `scripts/*sh`
When number of data points N > 10000, don't run any bubble programs (for all languages)
Show results as "N/A"

Note that bubble sort has O(n^2) and is too slow to run for large datasets

# Prompt 09: Run test several time

Currently, we run the performance tests only once for each language.

We should run the performance tests multiple times to get a more accurate measurement of the performance differences between the languages.

Add an option to the `scripts/run-all.sh` script to run the performance tests multiple times (e.g., default 5 times) and calculate the average time taken for each language.

# Prompt 08 Use a build tool 

Gradle?

# Prompt 07 

create a srcipts/run-all.sh script to do everything

add an option to clean data/results

generate data script

run comparision script

update documentations

# Prompt 06 

TODO: Note: This prompt is too big to process in one go. Please break it down into smaller parts.

- Breakdown by language and algorithm
- Breakdown by language and script
- Breakdown by making documentation updates

We have implemented Quick Sort in Python, C++, Java, and JavaScript, Go, and C.

Similarly, please implement the comparions for the following sort algorithms:

Note: 
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort
- Merge Sort

Update 
- code implementations
- performance scripts
- analysis scripts
- documentation

Ensure that the performance comparison includes all these sorting algorithms across the same languages (Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, Go, C).

When you  add new files, please follow the existing naming conventions and directory structure.


# Prompt 05

Lesson learned: We should have a better project structure before we start implementing new features or algorithms.

Restructure the project my moving files to new directories for better organization.

- Move all Quick Sort implementations to a new directory named `src`
- Move all performance scripts to a new directory named `scripts`
- Move all configuration files to a new directory named `config`
- Move all data files to a new directory named `datasets`
- Move all analysis files to a new directory named `analysis`
- Move all findings to a new directory named `docs`

Create a file named `README.md` in the root directory and explain the project structure and how to run the Quick Sort implementations and performance tests.

Create a file named `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` in the root directory and explain how to contribute to the project.

Create a file named `LICENSE.md` in the root directory and specify the license for the project (we use MIT License).

Create a file `docs/HOWTO.md` and explain how to run the Quick Sort implementations and performance tests.

Update all scripts and implementations to reflect the new directory structure.

# Prompt 04 

Please add Go, C implementations of Quick Sort to the existing study.

- Update the performance comparison to include these new languages.
- Create new source files for each language:
  - `quick_sort.go`
  - `quick_sort.c`

C compiler: gcc
Go compiler: /opt/homebrew/bin/go

Rerun the performance tests with the new implementations and update the findings accordingly.

# Prompt 03

Currently, 
the number number of datapoints N = 10, 100K, 1M are hardcoded in the code implementations of Quick Sort in Python, C++, Java, and JavaScript.

I want to make the number of datapoints N configurable by reading it from a configuration file named `number-of-data-points.txt`.

`number-of-data-points.txt` (pls create this file) sample content:
```
10
100000
250000
500000
```
Pls update the Quick Sort implementations in Python, C++, Java, and JavaScript to read the number of datapoints N from this configuration file.

Rerun the Quick Sort implementations in Python, C++, Java, and JavaScript using the new configuration.

# Prompt 02

For number of datapoints N = 10, 100K, 1M 

Generate 1M random integers and save them to a file named `random_list_N.txt`.

Rerun the Quick Sort implementations in Python, C++, Java, and JavaScript using this new dataset.


Run comparisons and performance analysis again:
For N = 10, 100K, 1M 
and update the findings based on the new data size.
