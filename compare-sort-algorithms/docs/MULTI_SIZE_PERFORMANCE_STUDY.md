# Multi-Size Performance Study

*Generated on: 06 June 2025*

This document analyzes how sorting algorithms scale across different data sizes.

## Scaling Analysis

This section shows how each algorithm's execution time scales with data size.


## Visualization

To better understand the scaling behavior, consider creating plots from this data. A log-log plot of execution time vs. data size would clearly show the asymptotic behavior of each algorithm and confirm their theoretical time complexities.

## Complexity Confirmation

Based on the data, we can observe:

- **O(nÂ²) algorithms** (Bubble, Selection, Insertion): Execution time grows quadratically with input size
- **O(n log n) algorithms** (Quick, Merge): Execution time grows slightly more than linearly
- **O(n) algorithms** (Counting, Radix): Execution time grows linearly with input size
