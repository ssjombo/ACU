# k-Means Clustering

k-Means clustering is one of the most popular and widely used unsupervised machine learning algorithms for partitioning data into groups or clusters. It is an iterative algorithm that aims to find the optimal grouping of data points by minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares.

## 1. Understanding k-Means Clustering

### What are k-Means Clusters?

**k-Means clusters** are groups of data points that are similar to each other and dissimilar to data points in other clusters. The algorithm partitions a dataset into k distinct, non-overlapping groups where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid).

### Key Concepts:

#### 1. **Centroids**
- The center point of each cluster
- Calculated as the mean of all data points in that cluster
- Represents the "average" characteristics of the cluster

#### 2. **Distance Metric**
- Usually Euclidean distance: $\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-y_i)^2}$
- Can also use Manhattan distance, cosine similarity, or other metrics
- Determines how "close" data points are to centroids

#### 3. **Objective Function**
- Minimizes the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS)
- WCSS = $\sum_{j=1}^{k}\sum_{x_i \in C_j} \|x_i - \mu_j\|^2$
- Where $x_i$ is a data point and $\mu_j$ is the centroid of cluster j

### How k-Means Works:

#### Step-by-Step Algorithm:

1. **Initialization**
   - Choose k (number of clusters)
   - Randomly select k data points as initial centroids

2. **Assignment Step**
   - Assign each data point to the nearest centroid
   - Calculate distance to all centroids
   - Assign to cluster with minimum distance

3. **Update Step**
   - Recalculate centroids as mean of all points in each cluster
   - New centroid = $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$ for all points in cluster

4. **Iteration**
   - Repeat assignment and update steps
   - Continue until convergence (centroids stop moving significantly)

### Mathematical Foundation:

#### Objective Function:
$$J = \sum_{j=1}^{k}\sum_{x_i \in C_j} \|x_i - \mu_j\|^2$$

Where:
- $J$ = Total within-cluster sum of squares
- $k$ = Number of clusters
- $C_j$ = Set of data points in cluster j
- $x_i$ = Data point i
- $\mu_j$ = Centroid of cluster j

#### Convergence Criteria:
- Centroids stop moving (change < threshold)
- Maximum iterations reached
- Objective function stabilizes

### Benefits of k-Means Clustering:

#### 1. **Simplicity and Efficiency**
- Easy to understand and implement
- Computationally efficient: O(nkd) per iteration
- Scales well to large datasets

#### 2. **Interpretability**
- Clear cluster centers (centroids)
- Easy to visualize and explain results
- Intuitive understanding of cluster characteristics

#### 3. **Versatility**
- Works with various data types
- Applicable to many domains
- Can be used as preprocessing step

#### 4. **Guaranteed Convergence**
- Algorithm always converges to a local minimum
- Deterministic results for given initialization

#### 5. **Scalability**
- Linear time complexity
- Memory efficient
- Parallelizable

## 2. Data Format Requirements for k-Means Clustering

### Essential Data Characteristics:

#### 1. **Numerical Data**
- All features must be numerical (continuous or discrete)
- Categorical data must be encoded (one-hot, label encoding)
- Text data requires vectorization (TF-IDF, word embeddings)

#### 2. **Comparable Scales**
- Features should be on similar scales
- Standardization or normalization is often required
- Prevents features with larger ranges from dominating

#### 3. **No Missing Values**
- Complete data required for distance calculations
- Handle missing values before clustering
- Imputation or deletion strategies needed

#### 4. **Independent Observations**
- Data points should be independent
- No temporal or spatial autocorrelation
- Each observation represents a distinct entity

### Data Preprocessing Steps:

#### 1. **Data Cleaning**
```
Original Data:
| ID | Age | Income | Education | Location |
|----|-----|--------|-----------|----------|
| 1  | 25  | 50000  | Bachelor  | NYC      |
| 2  | 30  | 75000  | Master    | LA       |
| 3  | 22  | 35000  | High School| Chicago |

After Cleaning:
| ID | Age | Income | Education_Bachelor | Education_Master | Location_NYC | Location_LA |
|----|-----|--------|-------------------|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1  | 25  | 50000  | 1                 | 0                | 1            | 0           |
| 2  | 30  | 75000  | 0                 | 1                | 0            | 1           |
| 3  | 22  | 35000  | 0                 | 0                | 0            | 0           |
```

#### 2. **Feature Scaling**
```python
# Standardization (Z-score normalization)
X_scaled = (X - μ) / σ
```

Mathematical formulas:
- **Standardization**: $X_{scaled} = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$
- **Min-Max normalization**: $X_{scaled} = \frac{X - X_{min}}{X_{max} - X_{min}}$
- **Robust scaling**: $X_{scaled} = \frac{X - \text{median}}{\text{IQR}}$

#### 3. **Dimensionality Considerations**
- **Curse of Dimensionality**: Performance degrades with high dimensions
- **Feature Selection**: Remove irrelevant or redundant features
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA, t-SNE, UMAP for visualization

### Optimal Data Structure:

#### Tabular Format:
```
| Feature_1 | Feature_2 | Feature_3 | ... | Feature_n |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----|-----------|
| 1.23      | 4.56      | 7.89      | ... | 2.34      |
| 2.45      | 3.21      | 8.12      | ... | 1.67      |
| 0.98      | 5.43      | 6.78      | ... | 3.45      |
| ...       | ...       | ...       | ... | ...       |
```

#### Matrix Representation:
$$X = \begin{bmatrix}
x_{11} & x_{12} & \cdots & x_{1n} \\
x_{21} & x_{22} & \cdots & x_{2n} \\
x_{31} & x_{32} & \cdots & x_{3n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
x_{m1} & x_{m2} & \cdots & x_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}$$

### Data Quality Requirements:

#### 1. **Sample Size**
- Minimum: k × 10 data points per cluster
- Recommended: k × 50+ data points per cluster
- Larger samples provide more stable clusters

#### 2. **Feature Quality**
- Relevant features for clustering objective
- Low correlation between features
- Appropriate feature engineering

#### 3. **Outlier Handling**
- Identify and handle outliers appropriately
- Outliers can significantly affect centroids
- Consider robust clustering methods

## 3. Interpreting k-Means Clusters

### Understanding Cluster Results:

#### 1. **Cluster Characteristics**
- **Centroid Values**: Average characteristics of each cluster
- **Cluster Size**: Number of data points in each cluster
- **Cluster Shape**: Distribution of points around centroid
- **Cluster Separation**: Distance between cluster centroids

#### 2. **Cluster Quality Metrics**

##### Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS):
$$WCSS = \sum_{j=1}^{k}\sum_{x_i \in C_j} \|x_i - \mu_j\|^2$$
- Lower values indicate tighter clusters
- Used for elbow method to determine optimal k

##### Between-Cluster Sum of Squares (BCSS):
$$BCSS = \sum_{j=1}^{k} n_j\|\mu_j - \mu\|^2$$
- Higher values indicate better separation
- Where $\mu$ is the overall mean

##### Silhouette Score:
$$s(i) = \frac{b(i) - a(i)}{\max(a(i), b(i))}$$
- Range: -1 to +1
- Higher values indicate better clustering
- $a(i)$ = average distance to points in same cluster
- $b(i)$ = average distance to points in nearest cluster
