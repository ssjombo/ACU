# K-Means Clustering - Ames Housing Dataset

## Overview

This analysis implements k-means clustering on the Ames Housing dataset to create new features for machine learning models. The approach follows the feature engineering methodology where clustering is used to create cluster labels and cluster-distance features.

## Dataset Information

- **Dataset**: Ames Housing Dataset
- **Observations**: 2,930 houses
- **Features**: 82 variables including house characteristics, location, and sale information
- **Target Variable**: SalePrice (continuous)

## Features Selected for Clustering

The following five features were selected for k-means clustering based on their relevance to house characteristics:

1. **LotArea**: Lot size in square feet
2. **TotalBsmtSF**: Total basement square feet
3. **FirstFlrSF**: First floor square feet
4. **SecondFlrSF**: Second floor square feet
5. **GrLivArea**: Above grade (ground) living area square feet

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Removed observations with missing values in selected features
- Applied z-score standardization to ensure all features are on the same scale
- Final dataset: 2,930 observations with 5 features

### 2. Optimal Number of Clusters
- **Elbow Method**: Analyzed within-cluster sum of squares for k=1 to 15
- **Silhouette Method**: Calculated average silhouette scores for k=2 to 15
- **Final Choice**: k=10 clusters (as specified in reference notebook)

### 3. K-Means Clustering
- **Algorithm**: Standard k-means with 25 random initializations
- **Convergence**: Maximum 100 iterations
- **Distance Metric**: Euclidean distance

### 4. Feature Engineering
Two types of new features were created:

#### Cluster Labels
- Categorical features indicating which cluster each house belongs to
- 10 cluster categories (1-10)

#### Cluster-Distance Features
- Continuous features representing distances to each cluster center
- 10 distance features (Centroid_1 to Centroid_10)
