# About this Dataset

## Context
This is an aggregate of the data I studied for my thesis titled, "Data Mining in Presidential Debates and Speeches: How Campaign Rhetoric Shaped Voter Opinion in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Race". The goal of my thesis was to use NLP techniques to understand how Donald Trump’s rhetoric impacted the opinions of various voter groups throughout his campaign. Here is a summary of my findings:

Trump’s words were typically more common in an American English corpus and more extreme on both ends of the sentiment spectrum
Trump not only used rhetorical devices for persuasion but also adeptly coupled these devices with the right talking points based on the composition of his audience
Precise execution of the above strategy garnered him an unexpectedly large number of votes from the white female and Hispanic demographics
I hope that others can use this dataset to answer questions of their own about the 2016 presidential campaign.
