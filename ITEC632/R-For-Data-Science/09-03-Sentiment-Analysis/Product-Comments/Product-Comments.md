This bed frame is absolutely useful and solid, would of been five stars however the usb port has a bright blue light that doesn’t switch off unless no power is supplied so above your head when sleeping you will notice said bright light.

The bed looks amazing. I bought two, one for each of my children, and they love it. They really love the USB port at the bedhead so they can charge their phones overnight. Take a while to put together but worth the effort.

Very sturdy bed! Love the storage space and colour. Was a little bit complex to set up, and the shelf/headboard is quite low which is a tiny bit disappointing - would’ve preferred it higher and not in line with my pillows.

This bed frame flat pack is pretty good! Wasn’t too tricky to put together but I do highly recommend using an electric drill otherwise you might be building it all day. It’s pretty good quality and is very sturdy. A thin mattress is recommended otherwise your head might knock off anything stored on the shelf!

Realistically this order seemed like one thing but arrived as something else. Everything arrived in boxes and it was 3 hours set-up which cost $150 for a professional assembler to do. Then the mattress has visible springs so a good topper costs $150-250 so set aside $1000 and a week for delivery and assembly.

Great bed frame. Easy to set up, and looks how it should. Really loving the charging ports and the shelf on the headboard.

Poor Quality – Broke During Assembly I purchased this bed frame and was very disappointed. The materials felt flimsy right out of the box, and unfortunately, it broke while I was trying to assemble it. The instructions were unclear, and the parts didn’t align properly, making the whole process frustrating. For the price, I expected something sturdier. I wouldn’t recommend this product—save your money and invest in something better built.

Seems like an ok bed. Took a few hours to put together, if you don’t have a drill then buy one, otherwise it’d take ages. It’s was pretty straightforward to assembled, but the design is a bit flimsy. If you drag this bed anywhere it would probably break. So keep this in mind when you’re putting it together as the best way to move it is too partially disassemble- but this wouldn’t take a great deal of time compared to the initial assembly

Best bed frame I have ever bought. I strongly recommend. It’s perfect night, the draws work great, it’s made for carpet and wood floors. The shelf is so handy, I put my phone there to charge every night, l have my meds and plants there. Easy to reach, not too low, not too higher, just perfect. If you want to sit up and lean against something, you can lean on the shelf. It’s honestly so good.

This rating covers: the courier, the build instructions and the product. Build instructions 3/5 Not bad, but not lego quality. Some of the diagrams were rather ambiguous, and required deciphering the next 5 steps to work out orientations. A number of minor items (floor protectors) were not provided inthe quantities specified (i had spare floor protectors from Bunnings, so could accommodate). You can assemble this with a screwdriver, but a driver/drill with phillips socket will be a much pleasanter experience. Product 3.5/5 Not bad, but a little flimsier than we were expecting. Sliding drawer wheels look to only work on hard floors: on carpet, their clearance below the drawer is insufficient. Summary; have made a 9y.o very happy for Xmas, but the delivery aspect was very poor.

This bed looks really nice and went together well, but I'm concerned about how long it was l will last. The slats are quite light and thin and I feel like over time they may not hold up. And the bed is connected in the middle creating a weak point any time the bed is moved both halves need to be properly aligned. It needs a bracket to strengthen each half to the centre support. But ideally would have one longer piece better supporting the entire length of the bed. The rollers on the drawers are only just touching and the edges of the drawer scrape on the floor like they need to be shaved a bit to create a bit more gap from the floor.

Value for Money wise - it’s a well put together bed. Instructions were well laid out and easy to follow. assembled by myself. all tools provided - however I chose a cordless drill … A lot of screws !! ahhhh. Only downside are the wheels beneath the draws…. the wheels are too small for carpet floors which would be the majority of homes i would think. Be good to give an option of a USB C charger as well for additional price.

The bed is too low and doesn't allow for a deeper good quality mattress. My husband has made quite a few adjustments.

Cath, Warrandyte, VIC Verified Buyer

 reply
Hi Cath, Were sorry to hear that the bed height isnt quite right for your mattress and that youve had to make adjustments. We understand how important it is for both comfort and functionality. If the bed frame is too low for your desired mattress height, you might want to consider using a thicker mattress topper or adjusting the bed's base if possible. Alternatively, our care team is more than happy to assist you with any exchange options or suggestions for bed frames that provide more clearance for a deeper mattress. Were here to help, so dont hesitate to reach out!

Product is defective. Bed keeps sliding out of the cot as there is no rim to block the bed from sliding

Kumaresh, HUNTINGDALE, VIC Verified Buyer

 reply
Hi Kumaresh, We're really disappointed to hear about the issue with the bed sliding out of the cot, as this definitely shouldn't be happening, and we understand how concerning it must be. Some cot designs may rely on weight distribution or additional fixings to secure the bed base, but if there's no rim to hold it in place, it certainly sounds like a design concern or defect. Were so glad you reached out to our care team and that we could work together to sort things out. Should you need assistance, were always here for you!

I did not like this bed at all. The bed is designed to hold a very thin mattress otherwise it looks disproportionate as the bed head is too low. The drawers have no support to stop them from rolling way under the bed. Furthermore, the bed came with a million screws and assembly was too hard. Be mindful that this is going to take a while to assemble. Not worth the money or effort.

Unlike the bed this replaced, it came in pieces and once put together was a complete bed. Whereas my old bed was once a complete bed but then slowly fell to pieces. I’m happy to have a proper bed again. The drawers and the usb charging port are a delightful bonus.

Easy to put together, and everything there. It's a shame you have to screw down the mattress base timbers though. Just means if you want to clean under the bed you either need to move it or unscrew it to vacuum

Really great bed! Love the look and super easy to assemble - only thing that could be improved would be drawers on both sides, and deeper drawers under the bed - they're quite narrow and could be double the length for more storage, otherwise great though.

Disappointed the bed head doesn't sit higher if you have a thicker mattress you cannot put anything on it as it's level with your pillows on the plus side it's nice and sturdy doesn't make any noises with movement.
