# Introduction

Is it possible to create an `.rmp` file from data WITHOUT using the RapidMiner AI Studio GUI?

This tutorial will guide how to turn data into a RapidMiner AI Studio process file.

# Prerequisites
- An AI coding agent (Cursor, Copilot, etc.)

# Basic Steps
1. Understand your objectives
2. Understand your data (input)
3. Understand your outputs
4. Describe what you want to achieve in a prompt
5. Instruct the AI coding agent to generate a RapidMiner AI Studio process file (.rmp) based on your requirements
6. Run the process file in RapidMiner AI Studio and make sure it works as expected

The best part here is how to write a good prompt.
