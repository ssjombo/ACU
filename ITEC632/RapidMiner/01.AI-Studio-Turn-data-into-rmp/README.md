# Introduction

Is it possible to create an `.rmp` file from data WITHOUT using the RapidMiner AI Studio GUI?

This tutorial will guide how to turn data into a RapidMiner AI Studio process file.

# Prerequisites
- An AI coding agent (Cursor, Copilot, etc.)

# Basic Steps
1. Understand your objectives
2. Understand your data (input)
3. Understand your outputs
4. Describe what you want to achieve in a prompt
5. Instruct the AI coding agent to generate a RapidMiner AI Studio process file (.rmp) based on your requirements
6. Run the process file in RapidMiner AI Studio and make sure it works as expected

Note: Likely, the `.rmp` file will contain some errors, you need to fix them manually.
