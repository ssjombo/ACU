# Personal Notes on Teaching Computer Science

This repository contains my personal notes and materials related to teaching computer science, including algorithms, data science, and programming concepts. Below are the main sub-repositories included in this collection:

## Repositories

### 1. Algorithms-in-Python

A comprehensive, hands-on introduction to fundamental algorithms using Python. It covers key algorithmic topics with clear explanations and practical code examples, suitable for beginners, students, and self-learners.

### 2. compare-sort-algorithms

A benchmarking suite for comparing sorting algorithm implementations across multiple programming languages (C, C++, Go, JavaScript, Java, Python). Includes scripts for automated testing, performance analysis, and visualization of results.

### 3. Machine-Learning-Algorithms

Comprehensive implementations of various machine learning algorithms with theoretical documentation and practical Python code. Includes linear regression, clustering, neural networks, ensemble methods, and more.

### 4. DataScience

Collection of data science projects and tools including OpenCV image processing, SQL joins demonstrations, TensorFlow/Docker containers, XGBoost implementations, and interactive dashboards built with Gradio and Streamlit.

### 5. ITEC203
