make test-setup

# Verify all notebooks
make verify-notebooks

# Quick test with shorter timeout
make verify-notebooks-quick
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Test a single notebook during development
python3 quick_test.py notebooks/01_basic_operations.ipynb

# Test all notebooks except slow ones
python3 verify_notebooks.py --exclude "07_advanced_techniques.ipynb,08_practical_applications.ipynb"

# Generate detailed report for CI
python3 verify_notebooks.py --save-report ci_report.json --verbose
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Custom timeout and stop on first error
python3 verify_notebooks.py --timeout 600 --stop-on-error

# Use bash script with verbose output
./verify_notebooks.sh --verbose --timeout 120
```

## ✅ Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Notebook Execution**: Uses `jupyter nbconvert` to execute notebooks
- ✅ **Error Detection**: Catches execution errors and timeouts
- ✅ **Timing**: Reports execution time for each notebook
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Shows real-time progress during verification

### Configuration Options
- ✅ **Timeout Control**: Configurable timeout per notebook
- ✅ **Selective Execution**: Exclude specific notebooks
- ✅ **Verbose Mode**: Detailed output for debugging
- ✅ **Stop on Error**: Halt execution on first failure

### Reporting
- ✅ **Console Output**: Colored, formatted progress and results
- ✅ **JSON Reports**: Structured output for CI/CD integration
- ✅ **Summary Statistics**: Total/passed/failed counts and timing

### Integration
- ✅ **Make Targets**: Easy-to-remember commands
- ✅ **CI/CD Ready**: Exit codes and structured reports
- ✅ **Development Friendly**: Quick single-notebook testing

## 📊 Verification Results

## 🔧 Dependencies Verified

The system verifies the following dependencies are properly installed:
- ✅ Python 3.13.5
- ✅ Jupyter (notebook execution)
- ✅ nbconvert (notebook conversion)
- ✅ OpenCV 4.12.0
- ✅ NumPy 2.2.6
- ✅ Matplotlib 3.10.3

## 🎯 Benefits

### For Development
- **Early Error Detection**: Catch notebook issues before users do
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure changes don't break existing notebooks
- **Documentation Quality**: Verify that tutorials actually work

### For CI/CD
- **Automated Testing**: Run verification as part of build pipeline
- **Quality Gates**: Prevent broken notebooks from being released
- **Reporting**: Generate structured reports for analysis

### For Users
- **Reliability**: Confidence that notebooks will execute successfully
- **Quick Validation**: Easy way to test local setup
- **Learning Experience**: Notebooks that actually work as expected

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple notebooks simultaneously
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track memory and CPU usage
- **Output Validation**: Compare notebook outputs against expected results
- **Integration Tests**: Test notebooks with different environments
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Track execution time trends
- **Dependency Analysis**: Detect which packages each notebook requires

## 📝 Summary

This verification system provides a comprehensive solution for ensuring that all Jupyter notebooks in the OpenCV collection can execute without errors. It offers multiple interfaces (Python, bash, Make), detailed reporting, and flexible configuration options suitable for both development and production environments.

The system successfully tested the existing `01_basic_operations.ipynb` notebook, confirming that the implementation works correctly and can serve as a reliable quality assurance tool for the entire notebook collection.
