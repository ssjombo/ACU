# Update `Makefile` 

Add a new target `verify-examples` to verify the examples by running `verify_examples.py` script. 

Als update "Make help" target to include the new target. 


# Create a list of important terms in OpenCV

- Save the reponse to `docs/important_terms.md`

The term should be list in 8 sections: 

- Basic Operations
- Image Filtering
- Transformations
- Morphological Operations
- Feature Detection

- Color Processing
- Advanced Techniques
- Practical Applications

Explain each term in 1-2 sentences, briefly. 

# Rename `examples/*py` files 

With numbering, e.g: 

- `01_basic_operations_demo.py`, 
- `02_image_filtering_demo.py`, 
- `03_transformations_demo.py`, 
- `04_morphological_ops_demo.py`, 
- `05_feature_detection_demo.py`, 
- `06_color_processing_demo.py`, 
- `07_advanced_techniques_demo.py`, 
- `08_practical_applications_demo.py`

also update the `verify_examples.py` script to verify the new file names. 

# Non-interactive running for all `examples/*py`

Current behavior: 
- When running `examples/*py`, it executes the script and displays results in a window, which requires manual closing.
- The script does not automatically close the display window after showing results.

Expected behavior:
- When running `examples/*py`, it should not display any windows or require manual interaction.
- The script should run all operations and save results to files without displaying them.

# Create docs 

Update `docs/README.md` to reflect the new file names. 

- `docs/examples/` for example scripts (e.g., `color_processing_demo.py`)
- `docs/notebooks/` for Jupyter notebooks (e.g., `01_basic_operations.ipynb`)
- `docs/src/` for source code modules (e.g., `basic_operations/image_io.py`)
- `docs/sample_images/` for sample images (e.g., `original/`, `processed/`)
- `docs/requirements.txt` for dependencies
- `docs/verification/` for scripts to verify code execution (e.g., `verify_examples.py`, `verify_notebooks.py`, `verify_src.py`)

# Notes: run with virtual environment

e.g: 
/Users/vuhung/00.Work/02.ACU/github/DataScience/OpenCV/.venv/bin/python examples/06_color_processing_demo.py

# Replace the author 

Current: Color Processing Demo - OpenCV Image Processing Collection
New author: Color Processing Demo - Vu Hung Nguyen

Folders to modify: 
- `examples/*py`
- `notebooks/*ipynb`
- `src/*/*py`

# Create a script to verify that all `examples/*.py` can run without errors,

No need for unit tests, just ensure they execute without issues.

# Split `02_image_filtering.ipynb` 

into multiple files, each focusing on a specific image filtering technique.

Don't delete or modify the logic, just split the content into separate files for better organization.

New file names should be:
- 02_01_gaussian_blur.ipynb
- 02_02_edge_detection.ipynb
- 02_03_noise_reduction.ipynb
- 02_04_custom_kernels.ipynb
- 02_05_custom_kernels_practical.ipynb
- 02_06_practical_applications.ipynb
- 02_07_exercises.ipynb

# Create a script to verify that all `notebooks/*.ipynb` can run without errors,

No need for unit tests, just ensure they execute without issues.

# Pls implement the notebooks

``` 
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/                         # Jupyter notebooks for tutorials
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 01_basic_operations.ipynb

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 08_practical_applications.ipynb
``` 

The first one (01_basic_operations.ipynb) is completed. 

# Create License.md and claim it to be MIT License

# Create a .gitignore file for this Python script

# Verify script 

create a script to make sure that all `src/*/*py` can run 

just make sure it can run without errors, no need unit test. 

help me decide the script name.
