# SQL Joins Demonstrations

This notebook demonstrates various types of SQL joins using SQLAlchemy, pandas, and matplotlib for visualization. 

1. **INNER JOIN**: Returns only matching rows between tables
2. **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right
3. **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left
4. **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Returns all rows from both tables
5. **CROSS JOIN**: Returns the Cartesian product of both tables
6. **SELF JOIN**: Joins a table to itself to establish relationships within the data
7. **NATURAL JOIN**: Automatically joins tables based on columns with matching names
8. **NON-EQUI JOIN**: Uses comparison operators other than equality for join conditions
