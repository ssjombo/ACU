# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The JavaFX Key and Mouse Event Demo application demonstrates event handling in JavaFX through two main components:

1. **MouseEventDemo**: Demonstrates mouse event handling with draggable text
2. **KeyEventDemo**: Demonstrates keyboard event handling with movable and editable text

## Architecture Design

### Component Structure

```
Launcher (Application Entry Point)
├── TabPane (Main Container)
    ├── MouseEventDemo Tab
    │   └── Pane with Draggable Text
    └── KeyEventDemo Tab
        └── Pane with Keyboard-Controlled Text
```

### Class Responsibilities

#### Launcher.java
- **Purpose**: Main application entry point
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Initialize the JavaFX application
  - Create the main window with tabbed interface
  - Manage the overall application lifecycle

#### MouseEventDemo.java
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates mouse event handling
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Create a draggable text element
  - Handle mouse drag events
  - Update text position based on mouse coordinates

#### KeyEventDemo.java
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates keyboard event handling
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Create a keyboard-controllable text element
  - Handle arrow key navigation
  - Handle text input for character changes
  - Manage focus for keyboard input

## Design Patterns

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Uses JavaFX's event system for user interaction
- Implements lambda expressions for event handlers
- Follows the Observer pattern for event handling

### Component-Based Design
- Each demo is a separate component extending Pane
- Modular design allows easy extension and modification
- Clear separation of concerns between different event types

## Cross-Platform Considerations

### Platform Detection
- Maven profiles automatically detect the target platform
- Platform-specific JavaFX dependencies are managed automatically
- Build scripts work across different operating systems

### UI Consistency
- Consistent styling across platforms
- Responsive design principles
- Platform-agnostic event handling

## Performance Considerations

### Event Handling
- Efficient lambda-based event handlers
- Minimal object creation during event processing
- Proper focus management for keyboard input

### Rendering
- Optimized text rendering
- Smooth drag operations
- Responsive UI updates

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- Safe text input handling
- Proper event filtering
- No sensitive data processing

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Individual component testing
- Event handler testing
- UI behavior verification

### Integration Testing
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
- Event system integration testing
- User interaction flow testing

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Extensions
- Additional event types (touch, gesture)
- More complex interaction patterns
- Animation integration
- Custom event handlers
- Accessibility features

### Scalability
- Modular design supports easy feature addition
- Event system can handle multiple simultaneous interactions
- Component-based architecture allows independent development
