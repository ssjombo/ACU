Base on the GeeksforGeeks article Selection Sort Simulation (JavaScript) below:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/selection-sort-visualizer-in-javascript/

The source code for the java version of Selection Sort is available at:
/Users/vuhung/00.Work/02.ACU/github/ITEC313/JavaFX/08-04-SelectionSortNew/src-javascript/index.html
/Users/vuhung/00.Work/02.ACU/github/ITEC313/JavaFX/08-04-SelectionSortNew/src-javascript/index.js
/Users/vuhung/00.Work/02.ACU/github/ITEC313/JavaFX/08-04-SelectionSortNew/src-javascript/style.css

Please create a JavaFX application that implements the selection sort algorithm, similar to the JavaScript version provided in the GeeksforGeeks article.

A sample working `pom.xml` file is available at:
/Users/vuhung/00.Work/02.ACU/github/ITEC313/JavaFX/08-03-ClosestPair/pom.xml

Sample folder structure for the JavaFX application:
/Users/vuhung/00.Work/02.ACU/github/ITEC313/JavaFX/08-03-ClosestPair/
```markdown
08-04-SelectionSortNew/
├── src/main/java/com/acu/javafx/selectionsort/
``` 

Documentation files should be included in the `docs/` directory, similar to the structure in previous projects.

Also update the `README.md` file to include instructions on how to run the application, similar to the other projects in the repository.

Your ouput should be a JavaFX application that visually demonstrates the selection sort algorithm, allowing users to see how the algorithm sorts an array of numbers step by step.
