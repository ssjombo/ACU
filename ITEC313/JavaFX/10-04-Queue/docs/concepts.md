# Queue Demo - Main Concepts and Design Decisions

## Data Structure Concepts

### Queue (FIFO - First In, First Out)
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle. Elements are added to the rear and removed from the front.

**Key Operations:**
- **enqueue(E e)**: Add element to the rear of the queue
- **dequeue()**: Remove and return element from the front
- **getSize()**: Get the number of elements

**Implementation Details:**
- Uses `java.util.LinkedList<E>` for efficient O(1) operations
- `addLast()` for enqueue operation
- `removeFirst()` for dequeue operation

### Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out)
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO principle. Elements are added and removed from the same end (top).

**Key Operations:**
- **push(E o)**: Add element to the top of the stack
- **pop()**: Remove and return element from the top
- **peek()**: View the top element without removing it
- **isEmpty()**: Check if stack is empty

**Implementation Details:**
- Uses `java.util.ArrayList<E>` for dynamic sizing
- `add()` for push operation (adds to end)
- `remove(getSize() - 1)` for pop operation (removes from end)
- `get(getSize() - 1)` for peek operation

### Priority Queue
A priority queue is a special type of queue where elements are dequeued based on their priority rather than their insertion order.

**Key Operations:**
- **enqueue(E newObject)**: Add element to priority queue
- **dequeue()**: Remove and return highest priority element
- **getSize()**: Get the number of elements

**Implementation Details:**
- Uses `Heap<E>` for internal implementation
- Heap maintains the highest priority element at the root
- `add()` operation maintains heap property
- `remove()` operation returns and removes root element

### Heap Data Structure
A heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property. In a max heap, each parent node is greater than or equal to its children.

**Key Operations:**
- **add(E newObject)**: Add element and maintain heap property
- **remove()**: Remove root element and maintain heap property
- **getSize()**: Get the number of elements

**Implementation Details:**
- Uses `java.util.ArrayList<E>` for storage
- Parent-child relationships: parent at index i, children at 2i+1 and 2i+2
- Heapify operations after add/remove to maintain heap property
- Comparator-based ordering for flexible priority definition

## Design Decisions

### 1. Generic Type Implementation
All data structures use generic types (`<E>`) to provide type safety and reusability.

**Benefits:**
- Type safety at compile time
- Reusable for any data type
- No need for casting or type checking

**Example:**
```java
GenericQueue<String> stringQueue = new GenericQueue<>();
GenericQueue<Integer> intQueue = new GenericQueue<>();
```

### 2. JavaFX Integration Strategy
The application uses a tabbed interface to demonstrate multiple data structures in a single application.

**Design Choices:**
- **Tabbed Interface**: Separate tabs for each data structure
- **Visual Representation**: Color-coded rectangles for elements
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate visual feedback for operations
- **Output Capture**: System.out redirection for test results

### 3. MVC Architecture
The application follows the Model-View-Controller pattern for clean separation of concerns.

**Components:**
- **Model**: Data structure implementations (GenericQueue, GenericStack, etc.)
- **View**: JavaFX UI components and visual representations
- **Controller**: Event handlers and business logic in QueueDemo

### 4. Cross-Platform Considerations
The project is designed to work seamlessly across different platforms and architectures.

**Implementation:**
- **Maven Profiles**: Automatic platform detection
- **Platform-Specific Dependencies**: JavaFX classifiers for each platform
- **Unified Build Scripts**: Single command execution across platforms

### 5. Test Integration
Original test classes are preserved and integrated into the JavaFX application.

**Approach:**
- **System.out Capture**: Redirect test output to JavaFX TextArea
- **Preserved Functionality**: Original test logic unchanged
- **Interactive Execution**: User-triggered test runs

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Visual Update Efficiency
- Only redraw displays when data changes
- Use temporary structures for visualization without affecting original data
- Platform.runLater() for thread-safe UI updates

### 2. Memory Management
- Proper cleanup of temporary objects
- Efficient data structure implementations
- Minimal object creation during operations

### 3. Scalability
- Data structures can handle large numbers of elements
- UI remains responsive with many elements
- Efficient algorithms for all operations

## Educational Value

### 1. Interactive Learning
- Visual representation of abstract concepts
- Real-time demonstration of operations
- Immediate feedback on user actions

### 2. Code Preservation
