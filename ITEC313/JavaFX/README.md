# JavaFX Course Projects

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of JavaFX-based projects designed to teach and demonstrate core concepts in Java programming, data structures, algorithms, and user interface development. Each sub-folder is a self-contained module focusing on a specific topic, ranging from basic JavaFX usage to advanced data structures and algorithms, with interactive GUIs and practical exercises.

## Sub-folder Overview

Each sub-folder follows the naming convention `0x-0x-TopicName` and contains:
- Source code (Java, JavaFX)
- Documentation (README.md, Prompt.md, PROJECT_SUMMARY.md, etc.)
- Images and resources
- Build scripts (Maven, shell/batch scripts)

### Example Subfolders

- `01-01-JavaFX-HelloWorld`: Basic JavaFX application structure and setup.
- `01-03-Panes.UI.Controls.Shapes`: Demonstrates JavaFX panes, UI controls, and shape drawing.
- `07-02-Sets-Maps`: Interactive demos of Java Sets and Maps, including HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, and TreeMap.
- `12-01-AVL-Trees`: AVL tree implementation and visualization, including rotations and balancing.
- `12-02-Probing`: Visualization of hash table collision resolution (linear, quadratic, chaining).
- `12-03-MapHash`: Custom Map and HashSet implementations with JavaFX GUI.

(See each subfolder's README.md for detailed objectives and features.)

## Target Audience

- University students in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or related fields
- Self-learners interested in Java, JavaFX, and data structures
- Instructors seeking modular, hands-on teaching materials
- Anyone preparing for technical interviews or practical Java development

## How to Use This Repo to Learn

1. **Start with Basics**: Begin with the `01-01-JavaFX-HelloWorld` and other `01-xx` folders to learn JavaFX fundamentals.
2. **Progress to UI and Controls**: Explore `01-03-Panes.UI.Controls.Shapes` and similar modules for UI components.
3. **Study Data Structures**: Move to `07-xx` and `12-xx` folders for in-depth data structure and algorithm demos.
4. **Follow the Order**: The folder numbering suggests a recommended learning path, from basic to advanced.
5. **Time Required**: Each module typically takes 1-3 hours, depending on complexity and prior experience. The full course can be completed in 2-4 weeks with regular study.
6. **Hands-on Practice**: Run the JavaFX applications, modify the code, and complete the exercises in each Prompt.md or README.md.

## Exercises for Learners

- Implement missing features or enhancements described in each Prompt.md
- Modify UI layouts and add new controls
- Extend data structures with new methods (e.g., add balancing to BST, new hash functions)
- Analyze and compare performance of different algorithms
- Complete the exercises and questions in each subfolder's documentation

- Each `0x-0x-TopicName/` folder contains:
  - `src/` (Java source code)
  - `docs/` (documentation)
  - `images/` (optional, for screenshots/diagrams)
  - `pom.xml` (Maven build file)
  - `run.sh`, `run.bat` (platform scripts)
  - `README.md`, `Prompt.md`, `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` (learning materials)

## Getting Started

See [INSTALL-DEV-ENV.md](INSTALL-DEV-ENV.md) for instructions on setting up your development environment (Java, Maven, JavaFX) on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
