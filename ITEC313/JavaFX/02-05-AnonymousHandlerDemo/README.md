Single Abstract Method Interface (SAM)
The statements in the lambda expression is all for that 
method. If it contains multiple methods, the compiler will not 
be able to compile the lambda expression. So, for the 
compiler to understand lambda expressions, the interface 
must contain exactly one abstract method. Such an interface 
is known as a functional interface, or a Single Abstract 
Method (SAM) interface.
