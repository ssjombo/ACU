# Single Abstract Method (SAM) Interfaces - Concepts

## Overview

This project demonstrates the concept of Single Abstract Method (SAM) interfaces, also known as functional interfaces, in Java. The application shows how these interfaces can be used with both anonymous inner classes and lambda expressions.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Single Abstract Method (SAM) Interfaces

A SAM interface is a functional interface that contains exactly one abstract method. These interfaces are the foundation for lambda expressions and anonymous inner classes in Java.

**Examples of SAM interfaces:**
- `EventHandler<T>` - `handle(T event)`
- `Runnable` - `run()`
- `Callable<T>` - `call()`
- `Comparator<T>` - `compare(T o1, T o2)`

### 2. Anonymous Inner Classes

Anonymous inner classes are inner classes without a name that combine declaring an inner class and creating an instance in one step.

**Syntax:**
```java
new InterfaceName() {
    @Override
    public ReturnType methodName(Parameters) {
        // implementation
    }
}
```

**Example:**
```java
button.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {
    @Override
    public void handle(ActionEvent e) {
        // handle the event
    }
});
```

### 3. Lambda Expressions

Lambda expressions provide a concise way to implement SAM interfaces.

**Syntax:**
```java
(parameters) -> { statements }
```

**Example:**
```java
button.setOnAction(e -> {
    // handle the event
});
```

### 4. Event Handling in JavaFX

JavaFX uses the event-driven programming model where:
- Events are generated by user interactions
- Event handlers (implementations of SAM interfaces) respond to events
- The `EventHandler<T>` interface is the primary SAM interface for event handling

## Design Decisions

### 1. Multiple Demonstration Approaches

The application provides three different demonstrations:
- **Anonymous Handler Demo**: Shows traditional anonymous inner class approach
- **Lambda Expression Demo**: Shows modern lambda expression approach
- **SAM Interface Concept Demo**: Explains the theoretical concepts

### 2. Interactive UI Design

- Clean, modern interface with intuitive navigation
- Visual feedback for user interactions
- Console output for educational purposes
- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes

### 3. Educational Focus

- Clear separation of concepts
- Step-by-step explanations
- Real-world examples
- Code comments for learning purposes

## Technical Implementation

### 1. JavaFX Application Structure

- **Launcher**: Main application entry point with menu system
- **AnonymousHandlerDemo**: Core demonstration of anonymous inner classes
- **Supporting Classes**: Additional demonstrations for different concepts

### 2. Event Handling Patterns

The application demonstrates several event handling patterns:
- Anonymous inner classes with `EventHandler<ActionEvent>`
- Lambda expressions with button actions
- Custom SAM interface implementations

### 3. Cross-Platform Compatibility

- Maven-based build system
- Platform-specific JavaFX modules
- Consistent behavior across different operating systems

## Learning Objectives

1. **Understand SAM Interfaces**: Learn what makes an interface a functional interface
2. **Anonymous Inner Classes**: Master the syntax and usage of anonymous inner classes
3. **Lambda Expressions**: Understand the relationship between lambdas and SAM interfaces
4. **Event Handling**: Learn how to handle JavaFX events effectively
5. **Code Organization**: Practice clean, well-structured JavaFX applications

## Best Practices

1. **Choose the Right Approach**: Use lambda expressions for simple cases, anonymous inner classes for complex logic
2. **Consistent Naming**: Follow Java naming conventions for classes and methods
3. **Error Handling**: Always include proper exception handling in event handlers
4. **Documentation**: Comment complex logic and explain design decisions
5. **Testing**: Test event handlers thoroughly to ensure proper functionality
