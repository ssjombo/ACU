# JavaFX Recursion Demonstrations - Project Summary

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive JavaFX application that demonstrates various recursion algorithms and concepts. It was created by fetching code from Pearson's Java Programming textbook examples and integrating them into a modern JavaFX application.

## What Was Created

### 1. Core Algorithm Classes (8 files)
All algorithms were extracted from the provided Pearson links and adapted to the `com.acu.javafx.recursion` package:

- **ComputeFactorial.java** - Classic recursive factorial implementation
- **ComputeFibonacci.java** - Recursive Fibonacci number calculation  
- **RecursiveSelectionSort.java** - Sorting algorithm using recursion
- **RecursiveBinarySearch.java** - Efficient search algorithm
- **DirectorySize.java** - Recursive file system traversal
- **TowerOfHanoi.java** - Classic recursive puzzle solution
- **ComputeFactorialTailRecursion.java** - Optimized tail-recursive factorial
- **RecursionDemo.java** - Main JavaFX application

### 2. Build Configuration
- **pom.xml** - Maven configuration with JavaFX dependencies
- **run.sh** - Unix/Linux/macOS execution script
- **run.bat** - Windows execution script
- **.gitignore** - Git ignore rules

### 3. Documentation
