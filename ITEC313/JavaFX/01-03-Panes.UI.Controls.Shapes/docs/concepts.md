# JavaFX Panes, UI Controls, and Shapes Demo - Concepts and Design Decisions

## Overview

This document explains the main concepts and design decisions used in the JavaFX Panes, UI Controls, and Shapes Demo application. The project demonstrates the use of various JavaFX panes, UI controls, and shape rendering.

## Core Concepts

### 1. JavaFX Application Structure

A JavaFX application extends the `Application` class and overrides the `start` method:

```java
public class MainDemo extends Application {
    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
        // UI setup
    }
}
```

### 2. Scene Graph

JavaFX uses a scene graph to organize UI elements:

- **Stage**: The main window
- **Scene**: The container for all content
- **Node**: UI elements (e.g., Pane, Button, Shape)

### 3. UI Components

- **Pane**: Layout containers for organizing nodes
- **UI Controls**: Interactive elements (e.g., Button, TextField)
- **Shapes**: Visual elements (e.g., Rectangle, Circle)

### 4. Event Handling

- Handles user actions for controls and shapes

```java
button.setOnAction(e -> {
    // Handle button click
});
```

## Design Patterns

### 1. Tabbed Interface Pattern

- Organizes different demos into tabs

### 2. Responsive Design Pattern

- Shapes and controls adapt to container size changes using property binding

### 3. Factory Pattern for Demo Creation

- Each demo class acts as a factory for its specific type

### 4. Template Method Pattern

- The `start()` and `paint()` methods define the workflow

### 5. Observer Pattern

- JavaFX property binding for dynamic updates

## Best Practices

- Separate concerns into different classes
- Use clear class and method names
- Document the purpose of each demo

## Conclusion

The JavaFX Panes, UI Controls, and Shapes Demo demonstrates the structure and concepts needed to build modular JavaFX applications. Understanding these concepts is essential for creating more advanced and maintainable JavaFX projects.
