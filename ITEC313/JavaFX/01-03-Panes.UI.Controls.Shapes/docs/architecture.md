# JavaFX Panes, UI Controls, and Shapes Demo - Architecture and Design Patterns

## System Architecture Overview

The JavaFX Panes, UI Controls, and Shapes Demo follows a modular, layered architecture designed for maintainability and extensibility. The application demonstrates various JavaFX panes, UI controls, and shape rendering capabilities.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer

**Components:**
- `MainDemo.java` - Main application window
- `Launcher.java` - Application entry point (if present)
- Individual pane/control/shape demonstration classes

**Responsibilities:**
- User interface rendering
- User interaction handling
- Visual feedback and styling
- Layout management

**Design Patterns:**
- **Tabbed Interface Pattern**: Organizes demonstrations into tabs
- **Responsive Design Pattern**: Adapts to window size changes
- **Observer Pattern**: Responds to property changes

### 2. Business Logic Layer

**Components:**
- Demonstration classes for panes, controls, and shapes
- Utility classes for calculations

**Responsibilities:**
- Creation and configuration of panes, controls, and shapes
- Property binding and dynamic updates
- State management

**Design Patterns:**
- **Factory Pattern**: Each demo class acts as a factory for its type
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different creation strategies
- **Template Method Pattern**: Common workflow for demos

### 3. Data Layer

**Components:**
- Property configurations
- Color and style definitions
- Constants and formulas

**Responsibilities:**
- Property definitions
- Color scheme management
- Configuration management

## Component Architecture

### 1. Main Application Structure

```
MainDemo (Application)
└── BorderPane (Root Container)
    └── TabPane (Content Container)
        ├── Tab (Pane Demo)
        ├── Tab (UI Control Demo)
        └── Tab (Shape Demo)
```

### 2. Demo Class Structure

Each demo class follows a consistent structure:

```java
public class Show[DemoType] extends Pane {
    public Show[DemoType]() {
        paint();
    }
    private void paint() {
        // Demo creation logic
    }
    @Override
    protected void setWidth(double value) {
        super.setWidth(value);
        paint();
    }
    @Override
    protected void setHeight(double value) {
        super.setHeight(value);
        paint();
    }
}
```

**Common Responsibilities:**
- Demo creation and configuration
- Responsive resizing
- Visual styling
- Property binding

## Design Patterns

### 1. Factory Pattern

Each demo class implements the Factory pattern for creation:

```java
public class ShowPaneDemo extends Pane {
    private void paint() {
        // Factory method for creating pane demo
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Encapsulated creation logic
- Consistent configuration
- Easy to extend and modify

### 2. Observer Pattern

JavaFX property binding implements the Observer pattern:

```java
control.property().bind(widthProperty().subtract(10));
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic updates when properties change
- Decoupled components
- Reactive UI behavior

### 3. Template Method Pattern

Each demo follows a common template:

1. Initialize the pane
2. Create demo in the `paint()` method
3. Handle resize events
4. Apply styling

### 4. Strategy Pattern

Different creation strategies are implemented for each demo type.

## Cross-Platform Architecture

### 1. Platform Independence

The demo is platform-independent and runs on any system with JavaFX support.

### 2. Dependency Management

- Uses JavaFX libraries as dependencies

## Performance and Error Handling

- Efficient redraws and property binding
- Basic error handling (if any)

## Testing and Deployment

- Manual testing by running the application
- Simple build and run process

## Conclusion

The JavaFX Panes, UI Controls, and Shapes Demo provides a modular template for building JavaFX applications with multiple UI components. Its architecture supports extensibility and maintainability for educational and development purposes.
