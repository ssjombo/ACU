# Prime Numbers Algorithms - Concepts and Design Decisions

## Overview

This document explains the main concepts and design decisions behind the Prime Numbers Algorithms Demo application.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Prime Number Testing

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The algorithms in this demo use different approaches to identify prime numbers:

#### Trial Division
The most basic method for testing primality:
- Test if a number n is divisible by any integer from 2 to √n
- If no divisor is found, n is prime
- Time complexity: O(√n) for each number tested

#### Sieve of Eratosthenes
An efficient algorithm for finding all primes up to a given limit:
- Create a boolean array of size n+1, initially all true
- Start with 2, mark all multiples of 2 as false
- Move to next unmarked number, mark its multiples
- Continue until √n
- Time complexity: O(n log log n)

### 2. Algorithm Optimization Strategies

#### Basic Trial Division (PrimeNumber.java)
- Tests each number individually
- Uses division up to n/2 (can be optimized to √n)
- Simple but inefficient for large numbers

#### Optimized Trial Division (PrimeNumbers.java)
- Uses √n as the upper bound for testing
- Reduces the number of divisions needed
- More efficient than basic trial division

#### List-Based Optimization (EfficientPrimeNumbers.java)
- Maintains a list of known primes
- Only tests against known primes up to √n
- Reduces the number of tests significantly
- Space complexity: O(π(n)) where π(n) is the number of primes ≤ n

#### Sieve Method (SieveOfEratosthenes.java)
- Marks non-prime numbers instead of testing each number
- Most efficient for finding all primes up to n
- Space complexity: O(n)
- Time complexity: O(n log log n)

## Design Decisions

### 1. JavaFX Application Architecture

#### Why JavaFX?
- **Modern UI**: Provides rich, modern user interface components
- **Cross-platform**: Works consistently across different operating systems
- **Event-driven**: Natural fit for interactive applications
- **Integration**: Easy to integrate with existing Java code

#### Application Structure
- **Main Application Class**: `PrimeNumbersDemo` extends `Application`
- **UI Components**: Uses VBox, HBox, ComboBox, TextArea, etc.
- **Event Handling**: Lambda expressions for button actions
- **Output Capture**: Redirects System.out to capture algorithm output

### 2. Algorithm Integration Strategy

#### Console Output Capture
Instead of modifying the original algorithms, we capture their console output:
- **ByteArrayOutputStream**: Captures System.out output
- **PrintStream Redirection**: Temporarily redirects System.out
- **Restoration**: Restores original System.out after execution

#### Input Simulation
For algorithms requiring user input:
- **ByteArrayInputStream**: Simulates user input
- **System.setIn()**: Redirects System.in to our input stream
- **Automatic Restoration**: System.in is restored after execution

### 3. User Interface Design

#### Layout Strategy
- **VBox Root**: Vertical layout for main components
- **HBox for Buttons**: Horizontal layout for action buttons
- **ScrollPane**: Wraps TextArea for scrollable output
- **Proper Spacing**: Uses Insets and spacing for clean appearance

#### User Experience
- **Dropdown Selection**: Easy algorithm selection
- **Input Validation**: Checks for required input
- **Real-time Output**: Shows results immediately
- **Clear Functionality**: Allows users to start fresh

### 4. Cross-Platform Compatibility

#### Maven Configuration
- **Platform Profiles**: Automatic detection of operating system
- **JavaFX Dependencies**: Platform-specific classifiers
- **Build Scripts**: Separate scripts for different platforms

#### Execution Strategies
- **Maven-based**: Primary method using javafx:run
- **Direct Execution**: Alternative method for advanced users
- **JAR Creation**: Maven Shade plugin for standalone JARs

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Algorithm Complexity

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Best Use Case |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| PrimeNumber | O(n²) | O(1) | Educational |
| PrimeNumbers | O(n√n) | O(1) | Small ranges |
| EfficientPrimeNumbers | O(n log log n) | O(π(n)) | Medium ranges |
| SieveOfEratosthenes | O(n log log n) | O(n) | Large ranges |

### 2. UI Performance
- **Non-blocking UI**: Algorithm execution doesn't freeze the interface
- **Output Streaming**: Results appear as they're generated
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of streams and resources

### 3. Memory Usage
- **Stream Management**: Proper closing of input/output streams
- **Output Buffering**: Reasonable buffer sizes for output capture
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic cleanup of temporary objects

## Educational Value

### 1. Algorithm Comparison
The application allows students to:
- **Compare Performance**: See how different algorithms perform
