# JavaFX Node Style and Rotate Demo - Architecture and Design Patterns

## System Architecture Overview

The JavaFX Node Style and Rotate Demo follows a modular, layered architecture designed for clarity and demonstration of JavaFX node styling and rotation features.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer

**Components:**
- `NodeStyleRotateDemo.java` - Main application window
- `Launcher.java` - Application entry point (if present)

**Responsibilities:**
- User interface rendering
- User interaction handling
- Visual feedback and styling
- Layout management

**Design Patterns:**
- **Simple Application Pattern**: Demonstrates node styling and rotation
- **Observer Pattern**: Responds to property changes (if used)

### 2. Business Logic Layer

**Components:**
- Main application logic (in `NodeStyleRotateDemo.java`)

**Responsibilities:**
- Node style and rotation logic
- State management

**Design Patterns:**
- **Template Method Pattern**: Common application workflow

### 3. Data Layer

**Components:**
- Static style definitions or resources

**Responsibilities:**
- Store style properties
- Configuration management

## Component Architecture

### 1. Main Application Structure

```
NodeStyleRotateDemo (Application)
└── Scene (Root Container)
    └── Node (Styled and/or Rotated)
```

### 2. Application Class Structure

Each JavaFX application follows a consistent structure:

```java
public class NodeStyleRotateDemo extends Application {
    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
        // UI setup
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }
}
```

**Common Responsibilities:**
- UI creation and configuration
- Node styling and rotation logic
- Visual styling

## Design Patterns

### 1. Template Method Pattern

The application follows a common template:

1. Initialize the application
2. Create UI in the `start()` method
3. Show the stage

### 2. Observer Pattern (if used)

JavaFX property binding can be used for observer behavior:

```java
node.rotateProperty().bind(someObservableValue);
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic updates when properties change
- Decoupled components

## Cross-Platform Architecture

### 1. Platform Independence

The demo is platform-independent and runs on any system with JavaFX support.

### 2. Dependency Management

- Uses JavaFX libraries as dependencies

## Performance and Error Handling

- Minimal performance considerations due to simplicity
- Basic error handling (if any)

## Testing and Deployment

- Manual testing by running the application
- Simple build and run process

## Conclusion

The JavaFX Node Style and Rotate Demo provides a foundational template for building JavaFX applications that demonstrate node styling and rotation. Its simple architecture is ideal for educational purposes and serves as a starting point for more complex projects.
