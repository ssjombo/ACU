# JavaFX Bouncing Ball Demo - Concepts and Design Decisions

## Overview

This JavaFX application demonstrates a bouncing ball animation with interactive controls. The ball moves within the boundaries of a window and bounces off the edges, while users can control the animation speed and pause/resume functionality.

## Main Concepts

### 1. JavaFX Animation Framework

The application uses JavaFX's animation framework to create smooth, continuous ball movement:

- **Timeline**: The core animation class that controls the timing and execution of animation frames
- **KeyFrame**: Defines individual animation frames with specific duration and actions
- **Duration**: Specifies the time intervals between animation updates (50ms in this case)

### 2. Event Handling

The application implements multiple event handling mechanisms:

- **Mouse Events**: `setOnMousePressed()` and `setOnMouseReleased()` for pause/resume functionality
- **Keyboard Events**: `setOnKeyPressed()` for speed control using arrow keys
- **Focus Management**: `requestFocus()` to ensure keyboard events are captured

### 3. Boundary Detection and Collision

The ball movement includes intelligent boundary detection:

- **Position Tracking**: Continuous monitoring of ball position (x, y coordinates)
- **Velocity Management**: Separate horizontal (dx) and vertical (dy) velocity components
- **Collision Response**: Velocity reversal when ball hits window boundaries

### 4. Animation Speed Control

The application provides dynamic speed control:

- **Rate Property**: Uses Timeline's `rateProperty()` for speed management
- **Incremental Changes**: Speed adjustments in 0.1 increments
- **Minimum Speed Protection**: Prevents speed from going below 0

## Design Decisions

### 1. Separation of Concerns

- **BallPane**: Handles ball animation, movement, and boundary detection
- **BounceBallControl**: Manages user interface, event handling, and application lifecycle
- **Clear Interface**: Well-defined public methods for external control

### 2. Responsive Design

- **Real-time Updates**: 50ms animation intervals for smooth movement
- **Immediate Response**: Event handlers provide instant user feedback
- **Focus Management**: Ensures keyboard controls work reliably

### 3. Cross-Platform Compatibility

- **Platform Detection**: Maven configuration automatically detects target platform
- **JavaFX Dependencies**: Platform-specific classifiers for different architectures
- **Build Scripts**: Separate scripts for Windows and Unix-based systems

### 4. User Experience

- **Intuitive Controls**: Mouse for pause/resume, arrow keys for speed
- **Visual Feedback**: Green ball with clear movement patterns
- **Window Management**: Appropriate window size and title

## Technical Implementation

### Animation Loop

```java
// Create animation with 50ms intervals
animation = new Timeline(
    new KeyFrame(Duration.millis(50), e -> moveBall()));
animation.setCycleCount(Timeline.INDEFINITE);
```

### Boundary Detection

```java
// Check horizontal boundaries
if (x < radius || x > getWidth() - radius) {
    dx *= -1; // Reverse horizontal direction
}
// Check vertical boundaries
if (y < radius || y > getHeight() - radius) {
    dy *= -1; // Reverse vertical direction
}
```

### Speed Control

```java
// Increase speed
animation.setRate(animation.getRate() + 0.1);

// Decrease speed (with minimum protection)
animation.setRate(
    animation.getRate() > 0 ? animation.getRate() - 0.1 : 0);
```

## Learning Objectives

1. **JavaFX Animation**: Understanding Timeline and KeyFrame usage
2. **Event Handling**: Implementing mouse and keyboard event handlers
3. **Boundary Detection**: Creating collision detection algorithms
4. **User Interface**: Building responsive and intuitive controls
5. **Cross-Platform Development**: Managing platform-specific dependencies

## Future Enhancements

- Multiple balls with different colors and speeds
- Gravity effects and physics simulation
- Sound effects on collision
- Configurable ball properties (size, color, speed)
- Network multiplayer functionality
