# Knight's Tour Project Requirements

## Project Overview

This project implements the **Knight's Tour problem** as described in Exercise 18.33 from "Introduction to Java Programming" by Y. Daniel Liang.

## Problem Statement

> (Game: Knight's Tour animation) Write a program for the Knight's Tour problem. Your program should let the user move a knight to any starting square and click the Solve button to animate a knight moving along the path, as shown in Figure 18.16.

## Requirements

### Core Features

1. **Display a chess board**
   - 8x8 grid with alternating light and dark squares
   - Visual representation of a standard chessboard

2. **User interaction for knight placement**
   - Users can click on any square to place the knight
   - Knight is represented by the Unicode symbol "♘"
   - Visual feedback when knight is placed

3. **Path visualization**
   - Show the path of the knight as red lines connecting visited squares
   - Display move numbers on each visited square
   - Clear visual indication of the tour progression

4. **Solve functionality**
   - Add a "Solve" button to start the knight's tour animation
   - When clicked, the knight will move along the path automatically
   - Animated movement with appropriate timing

5. **Reset functionality**
   - Add a "Reset" button to clear the board and start over
   - Allow users to try different starting positions

### Technical Requirements

1. **JavaFX Application**
   - Modern, responsive user interface
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Smooth animations and transitions

2. **Algorithm Implementation**
   - Backtracking algorithm to find a valid knight's tour
   - Efficient solution finding
   - Proper handling of edge cases

3. **Testing**
   - Comprehensive JUnit tests for the algorithm logic
   - Test coverage for knight movement validation
   - Integration tests for the complete workflow

4. **Maven Build System**
   - All Maven commands must work without errors:
     - `mvn test` - Run all tests
     - `mvn clean compile` - Clean and compile
     - `mvn javafx:run` - Run the JavaFX application

### Code Quality Requirements

1. **Simplicity**
   - Keep the code as simple as possible
   - Clear, readable implementation
   - Minimal complexity while maintaining functionality

2. **Documentation**
   - Comment the code to explain the logic for educational purposes
   - Comprehensive JavaDoc comments
   - Clear variable and method names

3. **Consistency**
   - Use the same structure as other projects in the repository
   - Follow the same naming conventions
   - Maintain consistent documentation structure
   - Use the same testing structure

### Educational Objectives

2. **JavaFX Programming**
   - Custom component development
   - Event handling and user interaction
   - Animation and visual effects
   - Canvas-based rendering

3. **Software Engineering**
   - Clean architecture and separation of concerns
   - Unit testing and test-driven development
   - Maven build system and dependency management
   - Cross-platform development

4. **Problem Solving**
   - Breaking down complex problems into manageable components
   - Implementing mathematical algorithms in code
   - Visual representation of abstract concepts

### Success Criteria

The project is considered complete when:

1. ✅ All core features are implemented and working
2. ✅ All Maven commands execute without errors
3. ✅ All JUnit tests pass
4. ✅ The application runs successfully on the target platform
5. ✅ Code follows the established patterns and conventions
