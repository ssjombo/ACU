# Add missing `architecture.md` and `concepts.md` to each sub-folder 

The following sub-folders are missing `architecture.md` and `concepts.md`: 
- 01-01-JavaFX-HelloWorld
- 01-02-JavaFX.Button
- 01-03-Panes.UI.Controls.Shapes

Use the structures of `architecture.md`, `concepts.md` similar to the sample files below: 

/Users/vuhung/00.Work/02.ACU/github/ITEC313/JavaFX/01-05-MoreShapes/docs/architecture.md
/Users/vuhung/00.Work/02.ACU/github/ITEC313/JavaFX/01-05-MoreShapes/docs/concepts.md

# Create a pom.xml file at the top folder

- with targets: clean, compile
- `clean` will `clean` all 0x-0y-zzz sub-folders 
- `compile` will `compile` all 0x-0y-zzz sub-folders 

# Generate `README.md` at the top folder
