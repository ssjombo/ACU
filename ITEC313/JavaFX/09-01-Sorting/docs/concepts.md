# Sorting Algorithm Concepts

This document explains the main concepts and design decisions behind the JavaFX Sorting Algorithm Visualizer.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Algorithm Visualization
The application demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work by providing real-time visual feedback. Each algorithm has unique characteristics that are highlighted through the animation:

- **Comparison-based algorithms**: Show how elements are compared and swapped
- **Divide-and-conquer algorithms**: Demonstrate recursive splitting and merging
- **Linear-time algorithms**: Show digit-by-digit processing

### 2. Educational Design
The application is designed primarily for educational purposes:

- **Step-by-step visualization**: Users can see each step of the sorting process
- **Speed control**: Allows users to slow down or speed up animations
- **Multiple algorithms**: Compare different approaches to the same problem
- **Interactive controls**: Generate new arrays and reset to original state

### 3. JavaFX Architecture
The application uses modern JavaFX patterns:

- **Model-View-Controller**: Separation of sorting logic from UI
- **Event-driven programming**: User interactions trigger algorithm execution
- **Animation framework**: Timeline-based animations for smooth transitions
- **Thread safety**: Platform.runLater() for UI updates

## Design Decisions

### 1. Algorithm Implementation
Each sorting algorithm is implemented as a separate class with static methods:

```java
public class InsertionSort {
    public static void insertionSort(int[] list) {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

**Rationale**: 
- Maintains separation of concerns
- Allows individual testing of algorithms
- Easy to add new algorithms
- Follows single responsibility principle

### 2. Animation Strategy
The application uses two animation approaches:

1. **Step-by-step animation** (Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort):
   - Pre-calculates all steps
   - Animates each step with Timeline
   - Provides detailed visualization

2. **Instant completion** (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Radix Sort):
   - Executes algorithm immediately
   - Shows final result
   - Suitable for complex algorithms

**Rationale**:
- Insertion and Bubble sorts are simple enough for step-by-step animation
- Complex algorithms would require extensive state tracking
- Balance between educational value and implementation complexity

### 3. UI Design Principles

#### Responsive Layout
- Uses VBox and HBox for flexible layouts
- Controls adapt to window resizing
- Consistent spacing and alignment

#### Visual Hierarchy
- Clear title and status information
- Logical grouping of controls
- Intuitive button placement

#### Color Coding
- Sky blue bars for normal state
- Consistent color scheme throughout
- High contrast for readability

### 4. Cross-Platform Compatibility

#### Maven Profiles
The project uses Maven profiles to handle platform-specific dependencies:

```xml
<profile>
    <id>mac</id>
    <activation>
        <os><family>mac</family></os>
    </activation>
    <dependencies>
        <!-- macOS-specific JavaFX modules -->
    </dependencies>
</profile>
```

**Benefits**:
- Automatic platform detection
- Correct native libraries
- No manual configuration required

#### Build Scripts
Platform-specific execution scripts:

- **run.sh**: Unix/Linux/macOS
- **run.bat**: Windows

**Features**:
- Dependency checking
- Error handling
- User-friendly messages

    Duration.millis(1000 / speedSlider.getValue()),
    event -> {
        // Animation step
    }
));
```

**Benefits**:
- Configurable timing
