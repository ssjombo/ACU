# Method-Overloading

Multiple methods with same name

## 📋 Overview
This project demonstrates **method overloading** in Java: defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. It is designed for Python developers transitioning to Java, highlighting differences and best practices.

## 📁 Files in this Directory

- `Makefile`: Build automation for compiling and running the project
- `README.md`: This documentation
- `examples/Example1.java`: Basic method overloading demonstration

## 🛠 Building and Running
```bash
# Compile the main program
make compile

# Run the main program
make run

# Clean compiled files
make clean
```

## 📚 Learning Objectives
- Understand method overloading in Java
- Recognize differences from Python's dynamic typing
- Learn Java syntax for overloaded methods
- Apply best practices for clear, maintainable code
- See real-world and practical examples

## 🗝️ Key Takeaways
- Java allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists (method overloading)
- Overloading is resolved at compile time based on argument types
- Python uses dynamic typing and does not require overloading for similar behavior
- Clear method signatures improve code readability and maintainability

## 📖 Important Concepts
- **Method Overloading**: Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or counts
- **Compile-time Resolution**: Java determines which method to call based on argument types at compile time
- **Type Safety**: Java enforces parameter types, unlike Python's dynamic typing
- **Varargs**: Java's `...` syntax allows methods to accept variable numbers of arguments (see `Advanced.java`)

## 🔍 Code Examples
```java
// Overloaded add methods in MethodOverloading.java
public int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
public int add(int a, int b, int c) { return a + b + c; }
public double add(double a, double b) { return a + b; }
public String add(String a, String b) { return a + b; }

// Usage
MethodOverloading mo = new MethodOverloading();
System.out.println(mo.add(2, 3));           // 5
System.out.println(mo.add(1, 2, 3));        // 6
System.out.println(mo.add(2.5, 3.7));       // 6.2
System.out.println(mo.add("Hi, ", "there")); // Hi, there
```

## 📝 Notes for Python Developers
- In Python, you typically use a single function with dynamic typing:
  ```python
  def add(a, b):
      return a + b
  ```
- Java requires explicit overloads for different parameter types or counts
- Java enforces type safety and resolves overloading at compile time
- Python's `*args` is similar to Java's varargs (`...`), but Java still requires explicit overloads for different types

## 🚫 Restrictions
- **NO TEST CODE**: No JUnit or test files included
- **NO USER INPUT**: All examples are self-contained
- **EDUCATIONAL FOCUS**: Code is clear, well-commented, and designed for learning
