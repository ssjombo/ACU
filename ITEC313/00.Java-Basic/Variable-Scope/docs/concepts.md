# Variable-Scope - Concepts

## Overview

This document explains the three main types of variable scope in Java: local, instance, and class (static) variables. Understanding scope is essential for writing clear, maintainable, and bug-free code.

## Key Concepts

### Local Variables
- Declared inside methods, constructors, or blocks
- Only accessible within the method/block where declared
- Lifetime: created when the method is called, destroyed when the method exits
- **Python Comparison**: Like variables inside a Python function

### Instance Variables
- Declared in a class but outside any method
- Each object (instance) has its own copy
- Accessible by all methods in the class
- Lifetime: as long as the object exists
- **Python Comparison**: Like attributes assigned to `self` in a Python class

### Class (Static) Variables
- Declared with the `static` keyword in a class
- Shared among all instances of the class
- Accessed using the class name or an object
- Lifetime: as long as the class is loaded
- **Python Comparison**: Like class variables in Python, but must use `static` in Java

## Best Practices
- Use the narrowest scope possible for variables
- Name variables clearly to indicate their purpose
- Use `private` for instance and static variables unless wider access is needed
- Initialize variables before use
- Avoid shadowing variables (declaring a local variable with the same name as an instance variable)

## Common Pitfalls
- Accidentally using instance variables when a local variable is intended (or vice versa)
- Forgetting `static` for class-wide data
- Accessing variables outside their scope (will cause compile-time errors)
- Shadowing variables, leading to confusion
