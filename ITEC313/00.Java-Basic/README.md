# Java Basic Projects ‚Äì Learning Repository

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Java programming projects, organized by topic and difficulty. It is designed as a self-paced learning resource for graduate students (especially those with Python experience) who want to quickly master Java syntax, paradigms, and best practices.

Each project is self-contained, thoroughly commented, and includes practical examples, data files, and documentation. The focus is on clarity, educational value, and hands-on experimentation.

## üöÄ How to Use This Repository

**Recommended Learning Order:**
1. **Start with Priority 1:** Essential Java syntax and basic programming concepts.
2. **Proceed to Priority 2:** Object-oriented programming fundamentals.
3. **Continue with Priority 3:** Data structures and collections.
4. **Advance to Priority 4:** Error handling and debugging.

**How to Learn Effectively:**
- **Read the code:** Study the main source files and examples. Pay attention to comments, especially those comparing Java and Python.
- **Run the code:** Use the provided `Makefile` in each project folder to compile and execute the code.
- **Modify and experiment:** Change the code, add your own examples, and recompile/run to deepen your understanding.

## üó∫Ô∏è Learning Path

1. **Begin with the `HelloWorld` project** to ensure your Java environment is set up.
2. **Work through Priority 1 projects** in order, focusing on syntax, data types, and control structures.
3. **Move to Priority 2** for object-oriented concepts (classes, inheritance, encapsulation, etc.).
4. **Continue with Priority 3** to master arrays, collections, and data structures.
5. **Tackle Priority 4** to understand error handling and debugging.
6. **(Optional) Explore further priorities** for file I/O, string processing, and advanced topics.

**For each project:**
- Read the `README.md` and code files.
- Run the code using `make run`.
- Try modifying the code and observe the results.
