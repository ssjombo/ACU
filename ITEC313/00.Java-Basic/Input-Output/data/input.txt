Hello World! This is a sample input file for the Input-Output project.
It contains multiple lines of text to demonstrate file reading capabilities.
Each line can be processed differently depending on the I/O method used.
This file is used by various examples in the project to show different reading techniques.
The content includes numbers like 42, 3.14, and text that can be parsed.
Some lines have special characters and formatting to test different scenarios.
This demonstrates how Java handles different types of input data.
The file ends with this final line for completeness.
