# Unit-Testing-Basic - Concepts

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to verify code correctness in Java without using any testing framework. It is designed for students transitioning from Python to Java, focusing on educational value and clear code structure.

## Key Concepts

### Main Learning Points

1. **Manual Code Verification**: How to check if your code works as expected using assertions and output.
2. **Assertions in Java**: Using the `assert` keyword and understanding its limitations.
3. **Error Handling**: Using `try-catch` blocks to handle errors and compare with Python's `try-except`.

### Best Practices

- Write clear, well-commented code
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Handle errors gracefully
- Compare results with expected values

### Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to enable assertions in Java (they are off by default)
- Not handling exceptions properly
- Assuming Java behaves like Python in all cases
