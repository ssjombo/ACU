# Operators-Expressions

## 📋 Overview
This project demonstrates all major Java operators and expressions, including arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, bitwise, ternary, increment/decrement, and operator precedence. It is designed for Python programmers transitioning to Java.

## 🛠 Building and Running
```bash
make compile   # Compile the program
make run       # Run the program
make clean     # Remove compiled files
```

## 📚 Learning Objectives
- Understand all Java operator types and their usage
- Learn operator precedence and associativity
- Compare Java and Python operator behavior
- Write clear, well-commented Java expressions

## 🔑 Key Takeaways
- Java operators are similar to Python, but with key differences (e.g., ++/--, integer division)
- Operator precedence affects expression results
- Use parentheses for clarity
- Bitwise and logical operators use different symbols than Python

## 📖 Important Concepts
- Arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, bitwise, ternary, increment/decrement operators
- Operator precedence and associativity
- Expressions and evaluation order
- Differences from Python (see code comments)

## 🔍 Code Examples
See `examples/Example1.java`, `examples/Example2.java`, and `examples/Advanced.java` for progressively complex demonstrations.

## 📝 Notes for Python Developers
- Java uses `&&`, `||`, `!` for logical operators (Python: `and`, `or`, `not`)
- Integer division in Java truncates (Python: `/` returns float)
- No `++` or `--` in Python
- All variables must be declared with types
- See code comments for more comparisons
