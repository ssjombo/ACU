## 🚫 Restrictions
- **NO TEST CODE**: Do not include JUnit or any testing framework
- **NO TEST FILES**: Remove any existing test files or test-related code
- **FOCUS ON LEARNING**: Prioritize educational value over testing
- Do NOT ask users for input in your Java programs

## 🎓 Target Audience
These Java projects serve as a **refresher/quick guide for graduate students** who:
- Have experience in programming (specifically Python)
- Understand basic programming concepts
- Need to learn Java syntax and paradigms
- Are transitioning from Python to Java

## ✨ Code Quality Requirements
- **Detailed Comments**: Every method, class, and complex logic should be thoroughly commented
- **Python Comparisons**: Include comments explaining differences from Python where relevant
- **Educational Focus**: Code should be clear and educational, not optimized for production
- **Consistent Style**: Follow Java naming conventions and formatting standards

## �� Content Guidelines
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, build up to more complex examples
- **Real-world Context**: Use practical examples when possible
- **Error Handling**: Include basic error handling where appropriate
- **Best Practices**: Demonstrate Java best practices and idioms

## 🔧 Technical Requirements
- **Java Version**: Target Java 8+ compatibility
- **Build System**: Use Makefile for compilation
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with clear instructions
- **Examples**: Multiple example files showing different aspects of the concept

## 📝 Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Main source file with detailed comments
- [ ] Makefile for build automation
- [ ] Comprehensive README.md
- [ ] Multiple example files (Example1.java, Example2.java, Advanced.java)
- [ ] Sample data files (input.txt, sample.csv)
- [ ] Concepts documentation (docs/concepts.md)
- [ ] No test files or JUnit dependencies
- [ ] Python-to-Java comparisons in comments
- [ ] Clear learning objectives and key takeaways

## 🎯 Success Criteria
The implementation should:
1. Be immediately runnable with `make`
2. Provide clear learning value for Python developers
3. Include comprehensive documentation
4. Demonstrate the concept thoroughly
5. Be well-commented and educational
