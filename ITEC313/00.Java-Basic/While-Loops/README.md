# While-Loops

While, do-while, infinite loops

## üìã Overview
This project demonstrates the use of while loops, do-while loops, and infinite loops in Java. It is designed as a refresher for graduate students familiar with Python, helping them understand Java's loop constructs and their differences from Python.

## üìÅ Files in this Directory
- `WhileLoops.java`: Main source code demonstrating while, do-while, and infinite loops with detailed comments and Python comparisons.
- `Makefile`: Automates compilation and running of the Java program.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.
- `examples/Example1.java`: Simple while loop example.
- `examples/Example2.java`: do-while loop example.
- `examples/Advanced.java`: Advanced loop usage and edge cases.
- `data/input.txt`: Sample input data for demonstration (not used for user input).
- `data/sample.csv`: Example CSV data for file processing demonstration.
- `docs/concepts.md`: In-depth explanation of loop concepts in Java.

## üõ† Building and Running
```bash
# Compile the program
make compile

# Run the program
make run

# Clean compiled files
make clean
```

## üìö Learning Objectives
- Understand the syntax and semantics of while and do-while loops in Java
- Recognize differences between Java and Python loop constructs
- Learn best practices for loop usage and error handling in Java
- Apply loops to real-world problems

## üóùÔ∏è Key Takeaways
- Java while and do-while loops: syntax, flow, and use cases
- Infinite loops and how to control them
- Differences from Python's while loops
- Common pitfalls and best practices

## üß† Important Concepts
- Loop initialization, condition, and update
- Entry-controlled vs exit-controlled loops
- Breaking and continuing loops
- Error handling in loops
- Avoiding infinite loops

## üîç Code Examples
See `WhileLoops.java` and files in `examples/` for:
- Basic while loop
- do-while loop
- Infinite loop with break
- Loop with file reading (no user input)

## üìù Notes for Python Developers
- Java requires explicit type declarations; Python does not
- Java's while and do-while loops are similar to Python's while, but Java has no direct equivalent to Python's for-else
- Java uses braces `{}` for block scope; Python uses indentation
- No list comprehensions in Java loops
- See comments in code for more comparisons
