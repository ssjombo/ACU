# StringBuilder-StringBuffer

## 📋 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer` in Java for efficient string manipulation, highlighting differences from Python and focusing on performance, mutability, and thread safety.

## 🛠 Building and Running

```bash
# Compile the program
make compile

# Run the program
make run

# Clean compiled files
make clean
```

## 📚 Learning Objectives
- Understand mutable string classes in Java (`StringBuilder`, `StringBuffer`)
- Compare performance of string concatenation methods
- Learn thread safety differences
- Practice Java best practices and idioms
- Recognize differences from Python string handling

## 🗝️ Key Takeaways
- `StringBuilder` is mutable and efficient for string manipulation
- `StringBuffer` is similar but thread-safe
- String concatenation with `+` is inefficient in loops
- Java strings are immutable (like Python), but mutable alternatives exist

## 📖 Important Concepts
- Mutability vs. immutability
- Thread safety
- Performance implications of string operations
- Error handling with string classes

## 🔍 Code Examples
See `examples/` for:
- Basic and advanced usage of `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer`
- Performance comparison
- Error handling

## 📝 Notes for Python Developers
- Python strings are immutable; use lists and `''.join()` for efficient concatenation
- No direct equivalent to `StringBuffer` in Python (thread safety)
- Java requires explicit use of mutable string classes for performance

## 🚫 Restrictions
- No test code or test files included
- No user input required
- Focus on educational value and clear documentation
