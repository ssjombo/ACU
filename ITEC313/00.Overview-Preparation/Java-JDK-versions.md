- **Support Status:** Oracle provides Premier Support for 6 months (until October 21, 2025). Not recommended for long-term production use.

## Additional Comparison Aspects

- **Performance:** Each new JDK version brings incremental performance improvements, especially in garbage collection, startup time, and memory usage.
- **Security:** JDK 24 introduces quantum-resistant cryptography, while JDK 17 and 21 focus on strong encapsulation and improved APIs.
- **Compatibility:** LTS versions (17, 21) are recommended for production due to longer support and stability. Non-LTS (24) is for early adopters and testing new features.

## Recommendations

- **For Stability (Enterprise Use):** Choose JDK 21 for its modern features (e.g., virtual threads) and long-term support until 2028 or beyond. JDK 17 is still viable for legacy systems but lacks newer productivity features.
- **For Cutting-Edge Development:** JDK 24 offers the latest features (e.g., quantum-resistant cryptography, structured concurrency), but its short support cycle makes it suitable only for experimental or non-production environments.
- **Migration Path:** Upgrading from JDK 17 to JDK 21 is recommended for LTS users due to improved performance, security, and features like virtual threads. Test applications for UTF-8 compatibility (introduced in JDK 18) before upgrading.
