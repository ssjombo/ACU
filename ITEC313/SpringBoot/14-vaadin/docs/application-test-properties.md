# Application Test Properties Configuration

## Overview
The `application-test.properties` file contains the configuration specifically for running tests in the Vaadin Spring Boot application. This file is located at `src/main/resources/application-test.properties-sample` and needs to be copied to `application-test.properties` for tests to work properly.


## File Setup
Copy `application-test.properties-sample` to `application-test.properties` in the same directory before running tests.
