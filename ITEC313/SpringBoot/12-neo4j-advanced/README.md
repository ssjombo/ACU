### Using Neo4j Browser

You can also access the Neo4j Browser at http://localhost:7474 to run Cypher queries directly:

#### Basic Queries
```cypher
// View all Person nodes
MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p

// Find people older than 25
MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.age > 25 RETURN p

// Count total people
MATCH (p:Person) RETURN count(p)
```

#### Advanced Graph Queries
```cypher
// Find all people who know Java and work on projects using Spring Boot
MATCH (p:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(t1:Technology {name: 'Java'})
MATCH (p)-[:WORKS_ON]->(proj:Project)-[:USES_TECHNOLOGY]->(t2:Technology {name: 'Spring Boot'})
RETURN p, t1, proj, t2

// Find all team members working on the same project
MATCH (p1:Person)-[:WORKS_ON]->(proj:Project)<-[:WORKS_ON]-(p2:Person)
WHERE p1 <> p2
RETURN p1.name, p2.name, proj.name

// Find all technologies used in projects with budget > 300
MATCH (proj:Project)-[:USES_TECHNOLOGY]->(tech:Technology)
WHERE proj.budget > 300
RETURN proj.name, collect(tech.name) as technologies

// Find all people with expert skills
MATCH (p:Person)-[:HAS_SKILL]->(s:Skill {level: 'Expert'})
RETURN p.name, collect(s.name) as expert_skills

// Find company partnerships
MATCH (c1:Company)-[:PARTNERS_WITH]->(c2:Company)
RETURN c1.name, c2.name
```

## Data Loading

### JSON Sample Data Loading

The application supports loading sample data from JSON files for easy configuration and customization:

#### Quick Setup
1. **JSON File Location**: `src/main/resources/data/sample.json`
2. **Automatic Loading**: Data is loaded automatically when the application starts
3. **Fallback Support**: Falls back to hardcoded data if JSON loading fails

#### Features
- âœ… **External Configuration**: Sample data is externalized in JSON format
- âœ… **Easy Modification**: Simply edit the JSON file to change sample data
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to hardcoded data if JSON fails
- âœ… **Version Control**: JSON file can be version controlled separately
- âœ… **No Additional Dependencies**: Uses existing Spring Boot Jackson support

#### Usage
```bash
# Edit sample data
vim src/main/resources/data/sample.json

# Restart application to load new data
mvn spring-boot:run
```

For detailed information about JSON data loading, see [README-JSON-Loading.md](README-JSON-Loading.md).

### Relationship Creation

The application includes advanced relationship creation capabilities to connect nodes in the graph database. This solves the common issue of having nodes but no relationships in Neo4j.

#### Problem
Your Neo4j database currently has 79 nodes but 0 relationships. This happens because entity classes were only creating nodes without defining relationships between them.

#### Solution
The application now includes relationship definitions and services to create relationships between existing nodes.

#### What's Been Added

**Updated Entity Classes:**
- **Person.java**: Added relationship definitions for:
  - `WORKS_FOR` â†’ Company (with position, startDate)
  - `WORKS_ON` â†’ Project (with role, startDate)
  - `HAS_SKILL` â†’ Skill (with proficiencyLevel, yearsOfExperience)
  - `KNOWS_TECHNOLOGY` â†’ Technology (with proficiencyLevel, yearsOfExperience)

- **Company.java**: Added relationship definitions for:
  - `HAS_PROJECT` â†’ Project (with projectType, startDate)
  - `USES_TECHNOLOGY` â†’ Technology (with usageType, adoptionDate)

**New Services and Controllers:**
- **RelationshipService.java**: Service to create relationships between nodes
- **RelationshipController.java**: REST endpoints to manage relationships

#### Available Relationship Types
```
Person -> Company: WORKS_FOR
Person -> Project: WORKS_ON  
Person -> Skill: HAS_SKILL
Person -> Technology: KNOWS_TECHNOLOGY
Company -> Project: HAS_PROJECT
Company -> Technology: USES_TECHNOLOGY
```

#### How to Add Relationships

**Method 1: Using REST API (Recommended)**

1. **Start your application**:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Create relationships**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/relationships/create
   ```

3. **Check relationship info**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/relationships/info
   ```

4. **Get statistics**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/relationships/stats
   ```

**Method 2: Using the Script**

1. **Make sure your application is running**
2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/create-relationships.sh
   ```

**Method 3: Using Neo4j Browser**

After creating relationships via the API, you can view them in Neo4j Browser:

1. Open http://localhost:7474
2. Run these Cypher queries:

```cypher
-- View all relationships
MATCH (n)-[r]->(m) RETURN n, r, m LIMIT 25

-- View people working for companies
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:WORKS_FOR]->(c:Company) RETURN p, r, c

-- View people with skills
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:HAS_SKILL]->(s:Skill) RETURN p, r, s

-- View companies using technologies
MATCH (c:Company)-[r:USES_TECHNOLOGY]->(t:Technology) RETURN c, r, t

-- View people working on projects
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:WORKS_ON]->(pr:Project) RETURN p, r, pr

-- View people knowing technologies
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:KNOWS_TECHNOLOGY]->(t:Technology) RETURN p, r, t

-- View companies with projects
MATCH (c:Company)-[r:HAS_PROJECT]->(p:Project) RETURN c, r, p
```

#### Relationship Properties

Each relationship includes relevant properties:

- **WORKS_FOR**: position, startDate
- **WORKS_ON**: role, startDate
- **HAS_SKILL**: proficiencyLevel, yearsOfExperience
- **KNOWS_TECHNOLOGY**: proficiencyLevel, yearsOfExperience
- **HAS_PROJECT**: projectType, startDate
- **USES_TECHNOLOGY**: usageType, adoptionDate

#### Expected Results

After running the relationship creation:

1. **Neo4j Browser** should show relationships in the left sidebar (no longer "Relationships (0)")
2. **Graph view** will display connected nodes with relationship lines
3. **Console output** will show statistics about created relationships

#### Features
- âœ… **Automatic Relationship Creation**: Creates realistic relationships between existing nodes
- âœ… **Rich Properties**: Each relationship includes relevant metadata
- âœ… **Random Distribution**: Creates varied relationship patterns
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing nodes
- âœ… **Statistics**: Provides detailed relationship statistics

#### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Make sure nodes exist first**: The relationship creation requires existing nodes
2. **Check application logs**: Look for any error messages
3. **Verify Neo4j connection**: Ensure Neo4j is running and accessible
4. **Clear database if needed**: You can clear and recreate the database if relationships get corrupted

#### Next Steps

Once relationships are created, you can:

1. **Explore the graph** in Neo4j Browser
2. **Write complex queries** to analyze relationships
3. **Add more relationship types** as needed
4. **Create visualization dashboards** using the relationship data

## Development

### Running Tests

The project includes comprehensive tests that:
- Test CRUD operations
- Use TestContainers for isolated testing
- Verify data persistence and retrieval
- Test custom queries
- Use profile-based configuration to avoid conflicts

```bash
mvn test
```

- **Dependency Injection**: Proper use of Spring's DI container
- **Repository Pattern**: Custom repository interfaces with advanced query methods
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separation with comprehensive services
- **Profile-based Configuration**: Environment-specific configurations (test vs production)
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Unit and integration tests
- **Clean Code Structure**: Well-organized package structure and naming conventions

### Key Components

#### DataPopulationService
- Implements `CommandLineRunner` for automatic data population
- Uses `@Profile("!test")` to avoid running during tests
- Creates realistic sample data with proper relationships
- Provides console output for monitoring the population process

#### Repository Interfaces
- Extend `Neo4jRepository` for basic CRUD operations
- Include custom query methods using `@Query` annotations
- Support parameterized queries with `@Param` annotations
- Provide advanced graph traversal capabilities

#### Entity Classes
- Use `@Node` annotations for Neo4j node mapping
- Include `@Id` and `@GeneratedValue` for primary keys
- Support all Neo4j data types and relationships
- Follow JPA-like patterns for consistency

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Neo4j connection failed**: Ensure Docker is running and Neo4j container is started
2. **Port conflicts**: Check if ports 7474, 7687, or 8080 are already in use
3. **Test failures**: Ensure Docker has enough resources allocated
4. **DataPopulationService not running**: Check that the application is not running in test profile
5. **Repository query errors**: Verify that custom query syntax is correct and parameters are properly bound

### Logs

Check application logs for detailed information:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Profile Configuration

The application uses Spring profiles to control behavior:
- **Default profile**: Runs DataPopulationService and connects to Docker Neo4j
- **Test profile**: Skips DataPopulationService and uses TestContainers for isolated testing

To run with a specific profile:
```bash
# Run with default profile (includes data population)
mvn spring-boot:run

# Run with test profile (skips data population)
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=test
```

## Cleanup

### If you used the Demo Script
The demo script automatically cleans up when you press `Ctrl+C`. If you need to manually clean up:

```bash
# Stop Spring Boot application (if running)
pkill -f "spring-boot:run"

# Stop Docker containers
cd docker
docker-compose down -v
cd ..
```

### If you used Manual Setup
To stop and remove the Neo4j container:
```bash
cd docker
docker-compose down -v
```
